For our project we've decided to build a text reader with a Maori vocabulary training component. It will allow users to open a variety of text file formats (txt, ePub etc) and it will replace a portion of the words with their Maori translation with the facility to hover over the word to see the original. It will have a library of public domain eBooks for users to read.

The software will come with extended learning features included, similar to spaced repetition it will cycle words in and out to increase the vocabulary retention, and have the ability to mark words as learned.

Our team consists of Jet, Jake, Matt & Cody ***Experience of each team member? ***
