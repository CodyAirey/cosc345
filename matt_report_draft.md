For our project we've decided to build a text reader with a Maori vocabulary training component. It will allow users to open a variety of text file formats (txt, ePub etc) and it will replace a portion of the words with their Maori translation with the facility to hover over the word to see the original. It will have a library of public domain eBooks for users to read.

The software will come with extended learning features included, similar to spaced repetition it will cycle words in and out to increase the vocabulary retention, and have the ability to mark words as learned.

datasets --

For our data we need a high quality English to Maori Dictionary, and repository of public domain books. The latter is easily decided, as Project Gutenberg offers a fantastic database of books to draw from. The dictionary is maybe not quite as straight forward, as although many exist, they are not always up to date and well digitised. We propose to get around this by drawing from as many datasets as we can and using it to inform our final dataset for translating. Some notable sources of this data are Te Ngutu Kura, the Maori spell checker 



What exists --

We found in our research that this idea has been looked at many times before. The core concept of our app has a basis in research, with the best known promotion of this concept being the Diglot Weave technique as it became to be known, start with R. Burling in his "outlandish" 1968 paper. Other similar techniques have been known as the "Clockwork Orange" technique coming from research in the late 90s that had noticed those who read A Clockwork Orange learned and retained Russian slang words very well. 

As for commercial ventures there are some notable examples. Prismatext (prismatext.com) cites the Diglot Weave technique as a core component of its technology. It has public domain books that have been edited by translators to slowly transition into a variety of different languages. Although it itself does not offer the ability to open your own text, and it does not appear to offer Maori as an option. 

We also found that the Clockwork Orange Technique was being used, rather amusingly, to write children's books by onethirdstories (onethirdstories.com). They focus largely on offering physical books and only aimed at younger readers. They also have a fairly limited language selection, Maori not being on the list. 

We also found Weeve (https://shop.weeve.ie/) which offers both an app and physical books for sale. This one is of particular interest as it is an Irish company that offers texts in Irish, which faces similar challenges to adoption as Maori does. Ultimately, they rely holy on preprepared text to offer their translations, and don't have the ability to open your own.

Other more promising searches from a feature point of view do appear, though often lead nowhere. We have loomVue(https://loomvue.medium.com/loomvue-sneak-peak-320c6e385dba) that seemingly offered an extension to do this but it doesn't appear obvious if this is still around or indeed ever made it to market. They did however take a machine translation approach and dealt with alignment issues.

Through all of this, we find a mixture of the features we like, yet nothing that is: free, open source, and offers Maori as an option. 

Interest--

Measuring interest is not exactly straight forward. The fact that there are commercial companies based around a similar proposition suggests that there is interest in the core idea of mixing a second language into a first language's texts. Although it is also notable that none of them do this with machine translation on a commercial scale. 

We also believe that we offer something unique, that is the ability to read ones own text, and that the language that is on offer is Maori. 

There is also a rather different cultural argument to its use in New Zealand, as New Zealand English (NZE) has a strong propensity to use Maori loanwords in place of their English counterparts. Data from the 2021 General Social Survey (GSS) showed that the ability of New Zealander's above the age of 15 to speak some Maori had increased. Between 2018 and 2021 the proportion of people able to speak more than just a few words or phrases in Maori had increased from 24% to 30%.

The same survey showed that 3 in 5 New Zealander's think that Te Reo should be a core subject in primary school. This suggests that there is at least some demand for Te Reo resources
