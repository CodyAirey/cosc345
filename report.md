# Intro matt

For our project we've decided to build a text reader with a Maori vocabulary training component. It will allow users to open a variety of text file formats (txt, ePub etc) and it will replace a portion of the words with their Maori translation with the facility to hover over the word to see the original. It will have a library of public domain eBooks for users to read. We see this as an option to replace the users default text reader, something akin to adobe pff reader but for all text. 

The software will come with extended learning features included, and will utitlize the diglot weave approach which involves reading text in the users native language then slowly replacing words with the language which they wish to learn. In this case the focus will be on replacing head words with their maori counterparts. It will cycle words in and out to increase the vocabulary retention, and have the ability to mark words as learned. The app will provide the ability to swap out the dictionary mappings to different languages etc english to spanish. 



Our team consists of Jet, Jake, Matt & Cody ***Experience of each team member? ***

Jake

I am a third year computer science student with interest in low level programming and design. I have some experience in natural language processing. I am well practiced in working with teams from my time as a chef, however this is the first time building an app as a team from scratch.   

# What datasets are we using?

Explain our datasets, why we chose them, how they combine and how that combination benefits the application. 

# How will we build it? 

Can add diagram of what I think it'll look like. Mention C++, Ultralight etc as possible technologies. 

Can mention the challenges we need to overcome to have a working app. Can discuss  
Look at roles our team members will take. Talk about Agileish (with that hint of waterfall) which will lead into our schedule.

include figma things

From a UI design perspective we are aiming to have a low clutter and simplistic design aimed to be easy on the eyes for long reading sessions. We have made some mockups in figma of some of the features that we envision for the app. These mockups will then be transferred to html and css using the ultralight framework as a html renderer. Figma itself allows for the designs to be exported to html and css, though there will also be some clean up on our end. Ultralight allows us to make an app using a UI framework we understand, html, but be able to easily couple it with C++. 

**Insert mockups here**

As seen we will have a landing page from which you can open recent books or documents. Additionally there is a sidebar which will show a typical file system to navigate to files, or optionally look through the users library.
